## How To Use
The BSJSC2 project consists of a main server and client server that function as separate entities. To use, provide the `args[1]` parameter with the number of servers. Only one main server is required, which should have at least 2 GB RAM and 100% CPU usage.

For side servers, you can obtain your bot's token and use it on any hosting service you prefer.

In Detail : Instead of always changing the number of servers do as in [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AreYouMehmetEfeisModder/bsjssay-degeri/main/x.txt) and paste your raw link in the lines in the code 
Now you need to find a server, you can find it from [this link](https://disboard.org/servers/tag/bot-hosting).
Remember, create only one main server, the more the side servers, the faster it will be, paste the total number of messages from the total number of messages to the raw server with showc2 and THAT'S IT

## Errors
I apologize for any mistakes or shortcomings in this project. Please feel free to contribute and make improvements.
Maybe the reason for the errors is that it is BETA and already nacl keys are now COMPLETELY encrypted, anyway maybe one day we can find the nacl key again
