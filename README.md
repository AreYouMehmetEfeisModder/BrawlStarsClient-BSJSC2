## How To Use
The BSJSC2 project consists of a main server and client server that function as separate entities. To use, provide the `args[1]` parameter with the number of servers. Only one main server is required, which should have at least 2 GB RAM and 100% CPU usage.

For side servers, you can obtain your bot's token and use it on any hosting service you prefer.
